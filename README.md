This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Hsin-Chieh Wang. I am master student of first grade and studying in the NVlab under Professor Chia-Wen Lin. I am strongly interested in machine learning. When I was in college, I was major in mechanical engineering. But my graduation final project is about deep learning and MRI. Because of the above reason, I want to learn more knowledge about machine learning. Thus, I decided to study in NTHU EE.


## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
As my self-introduction, I want to learn more about machine learning. In my opinion, machine learning is a huge field. Although machine learning can be uesd in data analysis, natural language processing , computer vision and artificial intelligence,It still require different knowledge when we training the model. My graduation final project is about CNN and MRI. And MRI is a branch of image processing. Thus, CV should be easier for me to get started with. By learn CV, I hope to learn more about ML.  


## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
1.Learn the technique of building and training ML model.

2.Learn how to preprocess different type of data.

3.Learn the understanding of CV from Professor and Assistant.

4.Apply the technique I have learned in class in other fields.

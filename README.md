This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

My name is Bolivar Enrique Solarte Pardo, I am from Ecuador (South America). I got my bachelor degree at the University of the Armed Forced ESPE, Republic of Ecuador 2012, in Mechatronics Engineering. Since that my passion always has been to learn and push myself forward. I finished my Master in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at National Taipei University of Technologies in Tapei-Taiwan 2017. There, I had the chance to foray into exciting fields such as machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, among others, which have become my passion and main motivation. Even though my work experience is more related to manufacturing processes and robotics, I started my Ph.D. at National Tsing Hua University in 2018, in the department of Electrical Engineering, in where my current research field is Computer Vision and Machine Learning, specifically SLAM applications.    

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

Computer Vision for me is one of the most exciting fields. I believe, Computer Vision underlines the possibility to make intelligence applications which can understand its surrounding by itself or boost important technological breakthrough. Computer Vision applications are a huge challenge which entail other important fields such robotics, electronics, programming among others, but CV is definitely the pivot for all of them.         

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]

I come from a major which is in some way related to robotics and electrical engineering, but a little related to CV. My goal at the end of this course is achieve a wide view about CV, reinforce some concepts as weel as learn new ones.

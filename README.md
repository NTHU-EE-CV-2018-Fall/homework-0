This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

I would like to pursue a master's degree in Taiwan and pursue a PhD degree abroad.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

I wish to know the basic knowledge about computer vision and have the ability to understand papers about computer vision.

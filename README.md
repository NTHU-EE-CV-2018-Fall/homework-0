# homework-0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
Hi! My name is Chen Kuan-Hung. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in electrical engineering. For me, writing codes to solve problems is quite interesting. I am still enhancing my coding ability now.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Actually I've joined a team in VSLab supervised by Prof. Sun for about six months. What the team works on is about anticipation and reminder of actions. The core concept of this topic is very related to computer vision. So I hope that I can learn more knowledge in this field.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
I think I will try to use the things that I learn from this course to improve my performance in the team. And also have a deeper understanding in computer vision. In addition, I also want to improve my coding skill after taking this course.

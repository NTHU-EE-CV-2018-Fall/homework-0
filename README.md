# homework-0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
我是一名大三物理系的學生，但也對電腦有點興趣
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
同上，因為對電腦有點興趣，看到大綱覺得有趣，就點來修囉
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
能學到東西就好，也許我之後可以找CS或EE的專題來做

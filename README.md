This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Yun-Hsuan Liu. I am a senior student, majoring in computer science. I have taken some graduate-level courses, like computer graphics and natural language processing. Besides the regular courses, I am currently working on an undergraduate special topic with assistant professor Chih-Ya, Shen in my department. In the last six months, I have completed a data science project about using machine learning techniques to help detect eating disorder patients.  We hope to use social media data to identify whether a user is a potential patient, so they can get medical care as soon as possible. After finishing this project, now I am focusing on the research related to pointer networks and combinatorial optimization.
Moreover, I have joined a Deep Learning Study Group in my university for a few months to learn the concepts and the cutting-edge practices of deep learning. I especially enjoyed machine learning theories and their applications in natural language processing and computer vision.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Because I think it is an impressive field that human can easily apply the theory or research to the future affairs. And, it's interesting to let the machine learn the visual world as we do.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
I want to get a better understanding of this field to lay a good foundation for the future research. Besides, I hope to sharpen my practical skill.

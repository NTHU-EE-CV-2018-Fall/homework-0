This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Jia-Hua Wu (吳佳樺, student ID: 104061149). I am a senior student from the EE department. I am interested in biology, especially neural science. I have passed most of the Life Science subject courses for freshmans and sophomores, and some neural science courses. Since the fundamentals of artificial neural networks come from neural science, I'm also interested in artificial neural networks. Also, I took "Special topic on Implementation" in professor Min Sun's VSLab last year. Our team project plays with protein function prediction using sequence embedding and deep convolutional network. I wish to study between biological neural network and artificial neural network in the future.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer images are widely used in our daily life, and its applications are really full of variety, such as animations, automatics, and biomedical images. This makes me want to learn more about graphics programming and computer vision. Moreover, computer vision is one of the most succesful field in artificial neural network applications. Although I have learned some deep learning knowledges, I haven't really put these knowledges into practice in the computer vision tasks yet. These are the reason why I want to take this course.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
I want to learn the methods of computer vision and apply them in practice, especially for image classification neural network and game animation design. I also study Graphics Programming & Application this semester. I want to collaborate the knowledge of Graphics Programming & Application with CV.

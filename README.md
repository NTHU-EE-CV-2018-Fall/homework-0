## Brief self-introduction
Hi, my name is 郭庭妤. I'm a first year student in ISA department.
I was major in Information Ststem when I was an undergraduate, so it's very exciting and challenging after I came to NTHU!

## Why Computer Vision? 
My advisor's research field is computer graphic and multimedia.
Recently, computer vision and machine learning is also related and become very important in this area.
However, it's difficult for me to understand those paper when our lab doing paper reading since I have no background knowledge.
But I do have Python programming experience.
That's why I want to take this course.
I want to know more about computer vision.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? 
I wish I can not only use some CV framework but also understand the theory and technology behind it.

# homework-0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am Wei-Cheng Tseng. I major in senior student of department of electrical engineering. Last year, I took "Special topic on Implementation" in professor Min Sun's VSLab. Our team project is dealing with protein function prediction using sequence embedding and deep convolutional network. Besides, since the performance of our method beat the state-of-the-art performance, we submit our work to AAAI 2019.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer images are widely used in our daily life, and its applications are really full of variety, such as animations, automatics, and biomedical images. This makes me want to learn more about graphics programming and computer vision. Moreover, computer vision is one of the most successful fields in artificial neural network applications, and lots of deep learning application may also integrate the techniques of computer vision, such as robotics. Therefore, we want to learn computer vision and combine the technique into my future research.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
I want to learn the methods of computer vision and apply these techniques in practice. I also study Graphics Programming & Application this semester. I want to collaborate the knowledge of Graphics Programming & Application with CV.
## Due Date: Sept. 28, 2018

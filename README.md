This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [max 500 words]
I want to know how do we evaluate the goodness/badness of the computer-vision techniques. How to confirm or convince others that a specific technique is outperforming? In addition, as the GAN is popular these years, can we use GAN to generate meaningful images/videos, so as to boost the performance of computer vision applications, such as self-driving car? What are the challenges of computer-vision applications using AI? I would like to find the answers to the above questions in this class.
